### Introduction

</p>Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) are an Arctic-endemic true seal species that depends on sea ice for key life stages and life history functioning, which places them at risk given the ongoing deterioration of their habitat. Monitoring this species is omplex and financially expensive due to the remote and often inaccessible nature of the habitats occupied by ringed seals, combined with harsh climatic conditions. In addition, the post processing image analysis is time consuming and expensive. In this MSc, I aim to create an object detection model based on the YOLOv8 architecture to detec ringed seals in aerial images taken by uncrewed aircraft systems (UASs).
