This repository contains the Python scripts used to implement, train, and evaluate the object detection model developed in this MSc. However, the repository does not include the datasets or additional files required for the different scripts. These datasets and files can be shared upon request.

### Introduction

</p>Ringed seals (Pusa hispida) are an Arctic-endemic true seal species that depends on sea ice for key life stages and life history functioning, which places them at risk given the ongoing deterioration of their habitat. Monitoring this species is omplex and financially expensive due to the remote and often inaccessible nature of the habitats occupied by ringed seals, combined with harsh climatic conditions. In addition, the post processing image analysis is time consuming and expensive. In this MSc, I aim to create an object detection model based on the YOLOv8 architecture to detec ringed seals in aerial images taken by uncrewed aircraft systems (UASs).

### Setup


</p> All scripts were executed in Google Colab.
</p>

</p> Each script specifies the required packages and libraries, as well as the steps followed for implementation.
